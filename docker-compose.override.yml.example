# This file is automatically merged with docker-compose.yml by Docker Compose.
# It exposes additional ports for development and debugging purposes.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file should NOT be used in production!
# For production, either:

#   2. Run: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
#
# Port Exposure in this override:
